# Twitter-RHO-Android_Challenge

This project consists on a challenge to a possible job.
Its objectives are:

- Get Twitter public feed using its streaming API;
- Search for a word provided by the user;
- Every tweet has a lifespan, meaning that after that time, they will have to be removed from the list;
- Once collected, the tweets will be included in a view;
- If the connection is interrupted or the app is run offline, the tweets that â€¨were alive during the previous execution will be shown until a connection is established.
